ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Netia Chitere. 

I am a healthcare professional with a keen interest in data and a passion for using data to drive insights and improve healthcare outcomes.

I have been certified as a Professional Data Analyst by Datacamp, and currently work as a Senior Data and Analytics Coordinator for a non-profit organization focussed on maternal and neonatal health.

I am looking to collaborate on data analysis and data science projects. I am excited to use my skills and experience to help organizations make data-driven decisions and drive meaningful change.

If you are interested in working together, you can reach me at nchitere@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you and exploring how we can collaborate on data-driven projects.

Please take a look at my portfolio of projects on my github profile, where I have shared my experience and skills in data analysis and visualization.

Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
